# Project 1 - Vortex Flowmeter Simulation </br>

Doxygen file and all code files are attached. The codes have Revision of 136 which means it will work with Keil u-Vision ARM IDE. </br>


1. A robust bare metal software that was optimized for the ARM M0+ architecture. </br>
2. A debug interface with various modes of operation which made the project interactive with debug messages and values. </br>
3. MATLAB simulation for flow mesaurement was done using zero crossing count function. This ensured all the calculations are done precisely using Internal Temperature and Frequency. </br> 
4. Implementation of flow calculation that took the vortex frequency of the flow and temperature of the liquid and gave an immediate measurement of flow, frequency, and temperature across the debug monitor. </br>


# Softwares Used:
Mbed Online Compiler </br>
Keil u-Vision IDE </br>
Tera Term - Default Baud Rate - 9600, 8N1 </br>
